### Calcal - The Calorie calculator
App that helps me count my calories

# My approach
- There is no calorie limit per day
- The original format is basically text, I used to do this in a text file, but it was still annoying to do calculations
- The goal is to learn how many calories are in food and to get good habits

# Format of data
There are multiple entries
Day's entry consists of date, section and day's total 
Meal section has items which are name, quantity and calories

# Example

Date: 7 April 2024

Breakfast - 166 kcal
- Cappuccino, 45 kcal
- Banana, 1, 121 kcal

- Total: 166 kcal
